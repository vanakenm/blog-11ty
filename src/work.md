Hello. I'm Martin, a 40ish years old software developer.

A long time ago, I majored in Economics, but I spent my whole career in software development, with a keen interest on education (coaching, teaching) aside from the "building" part.

Since then, I did pretty much every job possible in a software development company or department, generally around software developer or technical team leader role.

I live in Brussels, Belgium with my partner & my two kids.
