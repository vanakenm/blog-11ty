After three good years at [Pull Review](http://pullreview.com), I've started as a freelance developer. Wanted to see more companies, to experiment more too.

Right now, this means that I'm coaching 20 candidates-entrepreneurs at [LeWagon bootcamp](http://lewagon.org/en), Brussels session. The train has departed already, but we are opening more sessions this year, so don't hesitate to [sign up](http://www.lewagon.org/apply) or contact me for more details. If you have a startup idea but lack the technical skills to code it, join us!

At the same time, I'm still coaching a development team at [Swift](http://swift.com), both on the technical side and on the delivery side.

Working in both Startups & corporate environments has given me some perspective on both worlds. I love to hear about startups ideas - what's yours?

If you are interested in my experience, don't hesitate to [get in touch](#page-contact).
