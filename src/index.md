# Hi, I'm Martin

I've been coding and helping others to code for a while. Blog posts are just below, info about my experience is [here](/work). More about me on the [about page](/about).

I've been working as a freelance for a few years now. I tend to prefer missions in small companies or teams with a lot of autonomy. Nowadays I only work for companies with positive social impact - a subjective measure that generally means active in climate, health, education or similar sectors.

My collaborations can differ widely - from a couple of emails to help a first time founder with their technical challenges to leading a technical team for several years.

If you recognize yourself in the description above and want to work together, just <a href="mailto:martin@joyouscoding.com">send me an email</a>.
