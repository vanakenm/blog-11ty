Here is some feedback I got from previous customers/employers:

- Good use of emojis!
- Martin is our fresh-ish developer
- Don't know about his technical skills but his puns are really good
- You're really a generic developer
- The guy brings energy, stamina, gravitas, laughs, long hair, fancy t-shirts, network, Dark Vador puppets
- My new colleagues are a bunch of critical anarchists and it made me think of you
- Damn you are fast
- When other people pass after him for a speech or a lecture, it makes them feel like slow motion snails.
- This guy is a webinar by himself
- You are the king of OneDrive
- You make good points and proposals - it feels without any concerns for your job (when I ask if we really need to make the software at all)
- Martin Van Aken - "Martin the First" for those who know, long may he reign! (when I returned to a company I worked for before, where the new CTO is also named Martin)
- We don't need a boss. We just need someone to do for us what Martin is doing for the dev team (from a colleague in another team) 
- You know you are a cowboy so you temper it pretty well yourself
- After working with you, I now demand 120 words per minutes. Less than that it's a regression
- You are obviously not a bot
