Here is some feedback I got from previous customers/employers:

- Good use of emojis!
- Martin is our fresh-ish developer
- Don't know about his technical skills but his puns are really good
- You're really a generic developer
- The guy brings energy, stamina, gravitas, laughs, long hair, fancy t-shirts, network, Dark Vador puppets
