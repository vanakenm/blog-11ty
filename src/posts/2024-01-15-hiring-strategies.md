Part of my octopus job is often to run a team - which sometimes means creating it, and so be in charge of hiring. While I'm no hiring specialist, I did hire around 20 developers during my career (depending on many time you count St√©phan), and so developed some opinions about it.

## Be honest

## Involve the team

## Network effect

Good... and bad

It make sense to limit risk

## Juniors and Seniors

I like coaching young devs... but you need to have your cadre in place.
