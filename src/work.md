I've been building software and helping people build software for the last twenty years. I'm now working as a freelance. My full profile is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinvanaken/) but here are some relevant experience:

- I've spent 8 years early in my career at [M-Team](https://www.mloz.be) - a branch of Belgium's very complex and complete social security system. I learned a lot about complex, changing, law-based specifications, "legacy" systems and how to work together on a massive old codebase.
- I cofounded PullReview - a now defunct startup active in the automated code review area. While this ended up in failure, I learned a lot by having to do "a bit of everything" - from sales (I now know I'm quite bad at it) to marketing to HR to legal
- I worked several years as a freelance for [Swift](http://swift.com), helping to move a team from an operational model to a project based, coaching them into good software development practice. While I'm often critical of how big companies (and Swift) work, I learned how to succeed and deliver value in such environments
- I was [Bluesquare](bluesquarehub.com) CTO for 5 years, leading the company development team in high growth situation. This included developing and managing a product line, hiring and shaping a team and being part of the C-level management.
- I worked at [Shayp](shayp.com) on a major migration from Pyramid/Mongo to Django/Postgresql
- I always kept a coaching/teaching activity through various channel - I cofounded [LeWagon](http://lewagon.com) Brussels chapter and coached several batches of students there. I also created a custom bootcamp for a major Belgian Bank, giving new front end skills to a team of developers there. More recently, I coached at [Osoc](https://osoc.be/) and teached some React Native to a group of blind students via [Eqla](https://eqla.be).
- I was director of software at [Skills Union](https://www.skillsunion.com) where I managed the Software Engineering curriculum.
- I did a 3 months mission as technical advisor at [WHO](https://www.who.int) for [Bluesquare](bluesquarehub.com) to help create a platform to manage covid data - from collection to dashboards
- Finally I'm coaching/advising some early stages startup on technical matters.

I'm currently working mainly at two companies:

- I'm a senior developer at [IOS Press](https://www.iospress.com), an editor of scientific paper. I manage a pipeline extracting metadata to create a graph database out of them, with the associated front ends to query it.
- I'm a senior developer at [Beeodiversity](https://beeodiversity.com), a company that uses... bees and the pollen they collect to do pollution evaluation.

Technology wise, I generally use what is there/what the team knows, with emphasis in going with well established technologies as much as possible - popular stacks have a lot of examples and documentation available, large ecosystems and a good pool of developers to hire from - perks that are generally more important than the specific technical aspects.

I've worked (in a production setting) with Java, Ruby, JavaScript (and TypeScript), PHP and Python - I'll probably learn others as needed. I mostly work with web technologies even if I did some mobile dev too. Due to my Economics degree I tend to have a good grasp on statistics, so Data Science is generally accessible to me.
