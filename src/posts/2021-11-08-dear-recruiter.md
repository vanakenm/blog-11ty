Dear (LinkedIn) recruiter,
No, I won't accept your invitation to connect. This is not personal - it's because **in my 20 years of career recruiters have been utterly useless**.

I guess this sounds harsh, so I'll elaborate a bit.

What I get on a daily basis from recruiters is a version of this:

"Hi Martin, I have an incredible opportunity for you in a very disruptive company using blue and green technology. They have a very dynamic environment and offer a competitive salary. Can you give me a number I can call you on".

Generally missing are:

- What the company does
- What the team looks like
- The salary or rate range
- What's the work life balance

In a nutshell - I don't get any useful element to be able to even see if I could be interested. Instead I get a sort of template text with two technical words lost in the middle and a demand for my time.

I understand where this come from - if you as a recruiter starts saying anything meaningful about the company (not even saying getting me in contact with them), I'll probably be able to identify them, and your whole value disappear - your service cost a lot to the company and actually to me too!

But Martin you are not paying me? Well - maybe not in money, but in time. Instead of being able to talk (possibly convince) a future boss or colleague, I have to discuss with an intermediary with actually very limited knowledge about the job - and also a very different set of interest.

Generally you'll be paid (in the tens of thousands!) by getting people like me to sign contracts - so you need me (and a lot of other people) to sign 1/fast 2/for a lot of money if possible. The thing is, I'm generally not in a hurry and more interested to know/understand more about my future team and company - something that makes this relation very shaky.

When I look for a job, what I could get from you (I'm guessing as none of those ever happened) is three possible things:

- Get me in contact with jobs I could not reach myself
- Manage to "sell" me for an higher price that I could
- Get me better information about positions or companies than what I can find myself so I can find a job more adequate to what I want

From experience - none of those ever happen. 

- Companies have no incentive to "hide" their job post in a very challenging job market. 
- You never take the time to know me well enough to be an efficient agent (and hence able to sell me better than I can do _without going overboard_).
- Getting better information requires to get the company involved and at that time again you become useless to me - I prefer to cut out the intermediary.

For some "usual" questions:

- "Looking for a job yourself take time": It does indeed, especially as I tend to be a bit picky. But I'm not a company - I have only one "me" to "sell". I can afford to take a bit of time to find a place I'll be happy.
- "I'm different": I wish I could believe that - but finding out takes time. So if you really think so and want a call - pay me 250â‚¬ for the call. I promise I'll join, and if it's useful, maybe we can work together. I made that offer several times - no one ever took it.

So - I won't accept your invitation. The good thing is - you can probably find someone who will. I see that the recruiting industry is still alive and well - as mind boggling as this could be for me.

Martin

As a sidenote - this mostly do not apply to company internal recruiters - then tend to understand their company pretty well and are more closely related to the hiring team so there are much less friction in the relation.
