I used to be wary about "short stints" - staying less than two years at a company as an employee. I remember saying I needed three years to get at full capacity. It was not much about the tech (it can't be _that_ complicated), more about the landscape (business domain) and/or company structure (in large organization, you can need a couple of years to really know who to ask for what - and have the credit to pull it off).

## Bad rep

Internet seems to pretty much agree with the point, with a lot of advice on "how to explain short employment stints" - as if those were something shameful to hide or disguise.

As an aside, no one is telling _companies_ that short employments stints reflect badly on them - it's the usual asymmetry where things that are ok for companies are not ok for candidates - anyway.

The idea from the company/recruiters is that not staying "long enough" at a company make you unreliable.

## Meanwhile

I've left my last "long stint" almost three years ago now. During my five years at [Bluesquare](bluesquarehub.com) I barely did anything else - something I felt "came with the job" - I thought that as a CTO you _should not_ have time for much else, and I was feeling overwhelmed most of the time anyway.

Since that time I did only part time missions, most of them were shorter than a year - and I think I can say I provided value in pretty much every single one.

## What changed

- Mindset
- What I bring

## Added bonus

- Helps limit "being my job" as a full personality
