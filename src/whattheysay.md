Here is some feedback I got from previous customers/employers:

- Good use of emojis!
- Martin is our fresh-ish developer
- Don't know about his technical skills but his puns are really good
- You're really a generic developer
- The guy brings energy, stamina, gravitas, laughs, long hair, fancy t-shirts, network, Dark Vador puppets
- My new colleagues are a bunch of critical anarchists and it made me think of you
- Damn you are fast
- When other people pass after him for a speech or a lecture, it makes them feel like slow motion snails.
- They guy is a webinar by himself
- You are the king of OneDrive (no crown with the mandate, unfortunately)
