I'm by all possible measures a "Senior Developer" - at 46 years and 20+ in tech, I guess I've been one for a while.

To be honest, in an industry that "seniorize" people after 5 years, I probably deserve something more akin to "Ancient Developer" (having removed myself from the management path several time already).
