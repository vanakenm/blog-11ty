Having secured a small teaching position at the HE Vinci, I'm restarting my custom training offer. Here is a quick summary of what I can do to help upskill your team.

## For who ?

This is mainly an offer for companies large and small that are employing developers and interested in upskilling them. Whether it's young people you want to get up to speed or a seasoned team that could use help moving to the next technology, I can help by crafting a specific training for them.

My broad technological area is "web development" (backend, frontend, whatever) - if you think code training by a seasoned developer make sense, keep reading!

## How I work

I'm not a trainer - I'm a senior developer. My view on development is that's it's a craft - not a science, not an art. As any craft, it can be taught but what it really require is **practice**. While explaining high level concepts has it's use, the majority of the training time should be people coding - not listening. 

On a given day, I'd devote an hour to an hour and half on theory or examples - a good amount of them explained with code - the rest of the day is for the students to work on increasingly complex exercises crafted to make them understand *and apply* the concepts.

Some topics can be given in a couple of days (for example getting started in Pandas for people already familiar with Python) - some may require a week or even more (for example getting a whole team from jquery to modern front end development with - as an example - React and Tailwind).

A good group size is 6 to 12 - less and it become expensive but also less dynamic - more means I can't devote the attention that everyone deserve.

I don't only teach technology - I teach how to use it to produce actual value.

## My experience

I've been developing software and helping other develop software for more than twenty years - mainly as a developer, but often as a tech lead or CTO. I'm focused on delivering value - the technical aspects are just a mean to an end, which is always some business goal.

I've also taught code to dozens or hundreds of people - as a public teacher, as a trainer in bootcamps like [LeWagon](lewagon.com), [BlindCode](https://www.facebook.com/Eqla.asbl/posts/blindcodenotre-formation-en-codage-informatique-est-d%C3%A9sormais-compl%C3%A8te-vous-avez/2001946336617242/) or [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.be/). I've also crafted dedicated trainings for teams (mine or other people's).

I've worked in companies big and small, startups or big corporate (Swift, BNP, ...) alike. 

I've seen a lot of things - and got some understanding about things that works in theory but not in practice - and sometime the other way around. My advice is always grounded in reality.

## Some credits

Here are some feedbacks I've received as a teacher:

- BEST LEARNING EVER ! (caps theirs, not mine)
- Passionate and available teacher
- Very positive and upbeat which is nice for beginners. incredibly knowledgable. 
- Best training in my career
- He was very good at breaking down problems, extremely patient and always available to help. I'm not sure I would have been able to finish the bootcamp without his help. I thought about giving up almost every week, but he did his best to keep me on board.
