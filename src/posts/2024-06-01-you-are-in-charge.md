That may not be my most positive post of the year, but as far as advice go, especially toward (new) developers, this one is probably the most important: you are in charge of your career. You should trust someone else with that responsibility - especially not your employer.

I wish it was different, but it's not.

This means taking care of growing, getting (more) money, getting opportunities, etc.

## Money

Generally speaking, I've not see a lot of examples of "work hard and you'll be recognized" (as in - get raises, etc). I do believe you need to do the work - but also that when that's done, you need to come and ask for the money that comes with it.

In other words: it won't happen "by itself" and even if it does, you'll generally have more chance by asking - politely but firmly.

I don't think this is (always) due to cruelty or greed - more to oversight. As a manager, it's easy to "forget" about the person that do the work & never complain/create problems - especially when you have crisis to manage on a regular basis.

I would also advise against "alternative forms of recognition" - giving you a title does not cost the company a dime but won't help anything but your ego. Getting "more responsibilities" is a scam if you don't get more money (it's basically thanking you for your work with... more work).

There is a also a high signal value in raises - it is something that cost the company something - which means it's the only way to validate that they indeed value you.

So when the time come (after a big project/realization or during the yearly 1-1 or anything like that) - come prepared to bring the topic on the table if the company does not. Come with the receipts about your work, about what you delivered and ideally about how this is different from last year/what you were hired for.

If the company deflect by saying they don't have the means, start by focusing on getting them to say (ideally write) that the raise is deserved - then go back to the "we can't afford that" by being "reasonable" (maybe you can have half now and half in six months). Again, go for written/precise/contractual statements - avoiding the vague ones as much as possible.

## Opportunities

In order to grow, you need opportunities - ie jobs, positions, tasks that are slightly above or at least different from the ones you are used to do. This is generally a question of balance - too much of the same and you are stagnating, too different and it can be very stressful.

The main point is: doing the same thing for 2, 3, 5 years is going to "cost" you in terms of career. There are very few chances any of us can find employment for doing the same thing for 40 years - so at some point you'll need to change/update, and the latter it is, the more painful it will be.

So you need opportunities for "new things" - either in your current job or by jumping ship.

If you work for a big company, that means moving internally, getting on larger/different projects, asking for horizontal moves.

Again, I don't believe this will happen "by itself" - so it means keeping track of what's happening in the company, building an internal network so that when something open you know about it and can make a move.

The downside of this is that most of the value of a network you build inside a company will be worth nothing once you move on - something that will most probably happen at some point. Again, 40 years is a very long time.

If the opportunities do not materialized at your current job (because there are none or you can't get them), then it's time to start looking around. This means possibly leaving "good" jobs "just" because they don't provide enough opportunities. It may feel weird or even wrong initially - but on the long term, it's a very pragmatic position.

## Learning / Growing

This is very related to the previous point - you can't make your whole career on what you learned in your studies or at your first job. Seeing other things opens perspective. As a programmer, the usual example is language/ecosystems. While I understand some value of specialization, I think betting your career on single eco system is always a dangerous game. 40 years is long in term of technology - JavaScript will be legacy long before I'm retired, replaced by much "better"/"hyper" languages. I did use Pascal at some point, something that would be very difficult to find a job with today, etc, etc.

Same as above - when you stop learning, it's time to reevaluate your position.

## It's about leverage

A lot of this come down to working toward a situation where you are generally more valuable to the company than they are to you. When you know you can find another job, having sane relationship with your boss/employer because much easier. Asking for a raise is easier when you have a good idea that you could get that amount - there or somewhere else.

The point is not to go "Give me X or I'll get them somewhere else" - that's unnecessary rude - but knowing you can helps a lot. The example is about money, the general one is "Is it more difficult for me to find another job or for the company to find another me?".

Once you've gotten through the "leaving, interviewing, signing another job" a couple of times, it become much easier and less scary - this is a skill too, one that can be practiced and improved upon.

## Where it gets sad

I realized that this view (which is mostly the way I ended up behaving) is all about individuals and leverage and power dynamics - something not exactly aligned with my own values.

I'd like for our work relationships to be more about common good and interests of the many - but our industry generally scolds at unions or other forms of organization on the employee side - probably because we think we "don't need that". I'm quite sure we're going to regret it.

I found HR departments or equivalent to be generally at best hypocritical, at worse really dangerous (to employees) - I tend to agree with the general "HR is not your friend" sentiment.

Most people posting about the "glorious meritocracy" of the IT sector are generally delusional - they may be in privileged positions (like I am) now - but all of this could disappear at the next economic downturn.

## Conclusion

Despite all this, I've mostly worked for and with nice people - my point here is not a cynic "everyone is bad/wants to take advantage of you" more a realization that my career is my own to manage. I've seen my goals align with a company goals several times already, and we made good journeys together.

I just know that it will end, and I've less qualms than I used to at being the one that decide that it's time.
